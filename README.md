# datab-projects [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jryan814/datab-projects/HEAD)
Time for some 'data sciencing'

## Project Selection
I selected these projects to showcase some of the work I have done. They were chosen based on several factors, such as my personal interest in the project, the technical skills used, and the overall genre of it's application. Virtually all of the data I have worked with has been unstructured, requiring some degree of cleaning, transforming, and reconstructing.

Some of the libraries used are:  
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SQLite (sqlalchemy and sqlite3)
- scikitlearn

Technical Skills Used:
- Python
- SQL
- Statistical Analysis
- EDA
- Data Analysis and Visualization
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Web Scraping & APIs

## Project Descriptions (wip)
- Business Intelligence Tool Development (subfolder)
  -	Queried and extracted data subset (xxx,xxx records) from Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) based on NAICS codes, business size, and recency.
  -	Wrote Python and SQL scripts to report key business analytics to identify and target competitor companies, ranking by size and level of activity.
  -	Created visualizations in Tableau and Jupyter Notebooks to represent key market spaces.
  -	Reported detailed analytics on relevant competitor entities to enable improved business competition and identify potential targets for acquisition.
