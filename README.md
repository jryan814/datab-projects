# datab-projects
Time for some 'data sciencing'

## 18 projects completed
So far I have 18 projects completed, and am trying to figure out which ones I feel bridge the gap between interest and relevancy.
I did not upload the data sets for all projects.

Some of the python modules used are:  
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SQLite (SQLAlchemy and SQLite3)
