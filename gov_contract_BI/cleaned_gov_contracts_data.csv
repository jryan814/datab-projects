THE ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE FOR THIS WORK ASSIGNMENT WILL BE FROM AUGUST 4, 2011 THROUGH MAY 31, 2012.  THIS MODIFICATION ALSO REDUCES THE FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH WORK ASSIGNMENT 2-100 TO $20,729.78. THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE FOR THIS WORK ASSIGNMENT WAS FROM JULY 9, 2010 THROUGH MAY 31, 2011.   UNDER WA 3-101, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR FIVE REGIONAL TRIBAL AND TERRITORY SMALL WATER SYSTEM TECHNICAL TRAINING WORKSHOPS.  THE LOCATIONS FOR THESE WORKSHOPS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS BOSTON, ATLANTA, DALLAS, AND THE U.S. TERRITORIES OF GUAM AND SAIPAN.  THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO AS MANY OF THE EMPLOYEES OF TRIBES AND TERRITORIES AS POSSIBLE THAT RECEIVED AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) FUNDING FOR WASTEWATER AND DRINKING WATER PROJECTS.  THERE ARE 96 WASTEWATER PROJECTS AND 64 DRINKING WATER PROJECTS ON TRIBAL LANDS.  FIVE PROJECTS ARE IN THE US TERRITORIES.  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT UP TO 60 ATTENDEES WILL JOIN US AT EACH WORKSHOP IN GUAM AND SAIPAN, AND UP TO 40 ATTENDEES AT THE OTHER 3 WORKSHOPS IN THE CONTINENTAL U.S.  THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE WORKSHOPS IS TO TEACH SYSTEM OPERATORS AND MANAGERS HOW BEST TO OPERATE, TROUBLESHOOT AND MAINTAIN SMALL WASTEWATER AND DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS. THE WORKSHOPS WILL ALSO INCLUDE A MODULE FOR TRIBAL AND SYSTEM LEADERS ON EFFECTIVE UTILITY MANAGEMENT.  ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH SMALL, RURAL WASTEWATER SYSTEMS IS THE INABILITY OR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE BY THEIR OPERATORS TO MAINTAIN THESE SYSTEMS.  PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND US TERRITORIES CAN BE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING DUE TO HIGHLY REMOTE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES LACK ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY FOR WEBCASTS AND EVEN BASIC INTERNET ACCESS.    THE WORKSHOPS THAT WILL TAKE PLACE ON GUAM AND SAIPAN WILL ENABLE US TO REACH MANY SYSTEM EMPLOYEES INSTEAD OF JUST BRINGING A COUPLE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES TO WORKSHOPS ON THE MAINLAND.     THE CONTRACTOR SUPPORT STAFF IDENTIFIED FOR THESE ACTIVITIES MUST HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER, EXPERIENCE DEVELOPING TRAINING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES, PROFESSIONAL TRIBAL WORK EXPERIENCES, AND KNOWLEDGE OF DIFFERENT LEARNING STYLES AND TRIBAL AND TERRITORY CULTURE.   UNDER WA 2-100, THE CONTRACTOR PROVIDED SUPPORT TO EPA IN ITS MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT OF ARRA PROJECTS INCLUDED IN THE INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) AND THE INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE (IHS) THE CONTRACTOR SHALL:   A.

THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE FOR THIS WORK ASSIGNMENT WAS FROM AUGUST 4, 2011 THROUGH MAY 31, 2012.  UNDER WA 3-101, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR FIVE REGIONAL TRIBAL AND TERRITORY SMALL WATER SYSTEM TECHNICAL TRAINING WORKSHOPS.  THE GOAL WAS TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO AS MANY OF THE EMPLOYEES OF TRIBES AND TERRITORIES AS POSSIBLE THAT RECEIVED AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) FUNDING FOR WASTEWATER AND DRINKING WATER PROJECTS.  THERE ARE 96 WASTEWATER PROJECTS AND 64 DRINKING WATER PROJECTS ON TRIBAL LANDS.  FIVE PROJECTS ARE IN THE US TERRITORIES.  IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT UP TO 60 ATTENDEES WOULD ATTEND EACH WORKSHOP IN GUAM AND SAIPAN, AND UP TO 40 ATTENDEES AT THE OTHER 3 WORKSHOPS IN THE CONTINENTAL U.S.  THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE WORKSHOPS WAS TO TEACH SYSTEM OPERATORS AND MANAGERS HOW BEST TO OPERATE, TROUBLESHOOT AND MAINTAIN SMALL WASTEWATER AND DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS. THE WORKSHOPS INCLUDED A MODULE FOR TRIBAL AND SYSTEM LEADERS ON EFFECTIVE UTILITY MANAGEMENT.  ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH SMALL, RURAL WASTEWATER SYSTEMS IS THE INABILITY OR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE BY THEIR OPERATORS TO MAINTAIN THESE SYSTEMS.  PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND US TERRITORIES CAN BE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING DUE TO HIGHLY REMOTE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES LACK ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY FOR WEBCASTS AND EVEN BASIC INTERNET ACCESS.

THE ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE FOR THIS WORK ASSIGNMENT WILL BE FROM AUGUST 4, 2011 THROUGH MAY 31, 2012.  THIS MODIFICATION ALSO REDUCES THE FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH WORK ASSIGNMENT 2-100 TO $20,729.78. THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE FOR THIS WORK ASSIGNMENT WAS FROM JULY 9, 2010 THROUGH MAY 31, 2011.  UNDER WA 3-101, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR FIVE REGIONAL TRIBAL AND TERRITORY SMALL WATER SYSTEM TECHNICAL TRAINING WORKSHOPS.  THE LOCATIONS FOR THESE WORKSHOPS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS BOSTON, ATLANTA, DALLAS, AND THE U.S. TERRITORIES OF GUAM AND SAIPAN.  THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO AS MANY OF THE EMPLOYEES OF TRIBES AND TERRITORIES AS POSSIBLE THAT RECEIVED AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) FUNDING FOR WASTEWATER AND DRINKING WATER PROJECTS.  THERE ARE 96 WASTEWATER PROJECTS AND 64 DRINKING WATER PROJECTS ON TRIBAL LANDS.  FIVE PROJECTS ARE IN THE US TERRITORIES.  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT UP TO 60 ATTENDEES WILL JOIN US AT EACH WORKSHOP IN GUAM AND SAIPAN, AND UP TO 40 ATTENDEES AT THE OTHER 3 WORKSHOPS IN THE CONTINENTAL U.S.  THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE WORKSHOPS IS TO TEACH SYSTEM OPERATORS AND MANAGERS HOW BEST TO OPERATE, TROUBLESHOOT AND MAINTAIN SMALL WASTEWATER AND DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS. THE WORKSHOPS WILL ALSO INCLUDE A MODULE FOR TRIBAL AND SYSTEM LEADERS ON EFFECTIVE UTILITY MANAGEMENT.  ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH SMALL, RURAL WASTEWATER SYSTEMS IS THE INABILITY OR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE BY THEIR OPERATORS TO MAINTAIN THESE SYSTEMS.  PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND US TERRITORIES CAN BE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING DUE TO HIGHLY REMOTE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES LACK ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY FOR WEBCASTS AND EVEN BASIC INTERNET ACCESS.    THE WORKSHOPS THAT WILL TAKE PLACE ON GUAM AND SAIPAN WILL ENABLE US TO REACH MANY SYSTEM EMPLOYEES INSTEAD OF JUST BRINGING A COUPLE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES TO WORKSHOPS ON THE MAINLAND.     THE CONTRACTOR SUPPORT STAFF IDENTIFIED FOR THESE ACTIVITIES MUST HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER, EXPERIENCE DEVELOPING TRAINING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES, PROFESSIONAL TRIBAL WORK EXPERIENCES, AND KNOWLEDGE OF DIFFERENT LEARNING STYLES AND TRIBAL AND TERRITORY CULTURE.
